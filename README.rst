OpenPGP smartcard application implementation.

It implements parts of the OpenPGP specification 3.4.1 .

Warning
-------

**THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS.**

- it may not be fully functional
- future upgrades may bring changes incompatible with previous version's stored
  data
- despite best attention, it may contain security holes:

  - it may allow access to unexpected pieces of data
  - cryptographic functions may contain bugs making decryption either
    impossible or trivial to an attacker

- it may support weak cryptographic algorithms (weak hashes, weak elliptic
  curves, ...)

Fee free to play with it, review it and contribute. But **DO NOT USE IT ON
SENSIBLE OR VALUABLE DATA**, and **DO NOT IMPORT VALUABLE KEYS IN IT**.

This code is in dire need for reviewing and testing.

Installation
------------

No extra hardware requirements
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To get a standard card, with an executable setting up a gadget.

.. code:: shell

  pip install smartcard-app-openpgp[ccid]

Then, you may set it up to automatically start on boot (assuming `pip` comes
fom a virtualenv at `/opt/smartcard-openpgp`):

- create a systemd service:

  .. code:: ini

    [Unit]
    Description=Behave like a CCID + smartcard combo USB device

    [Service]
    ExecStart=/opt/smartcard-openpgp/bin/smartcard-openpgp-simple \
      --user smartcard-openpgp \
      --filestorage /srv/smartcard-openpgp/card.fs

    [Install]
    WantedBy=usb-gadget.target

- create a system user, enable the systemd service, and start it:

  .. code:: shell

    adduser --system --home /srv/smartcard-openpgp smartcard-openpgp
    systemctl enable smartcard-gadget.service
    systemctl start smartcard-gadget.service

USB-device-capable Raspberry Pi with `Waveshare 2.13 inches e-Paper display V1`_
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This extra hardware enables the use of a random PW1 PIN.

The e-Paper display presents a grid of random values. One cell (A1 by default)
contains the valid PIN.

The cell containing the valid PIN can be changed by requesting a PW1 change, and
providing a specially-formatted new password.
For example: `C30000` references cell `C3`, `2b0000` references cell `B2`.
Trailing zeroes are ignored.

The grid changes periodically, as the card is used (at most once every
30 seconds), and both the currently-displayed (at the time the "verify" command
runs ont the card) and the previous PIN are accepted as a correct PIN.

Key Derivation Function (KDF-DO) is not available in this mode.

Similar to the `No extra hardware requirements`_ variant, but starting with:

.. code:: shell

  pip install smartcard-app-openpgp[ccid,randpin]

The executable is then called `smartcard-openpgp-randpin-epaper` rather than
`smartcard-openpgp-simple`.

External requirements
*********************

Beyond the installation/build requirements, the code expected the Noto Mono
font to be located at `/usr/share/fonts/truetype/noto/NotoMono-Regular.ttf`:

  .. code:: shell

    apt-get install fonts-noto-mono

Limitations
***********

The Raspberry Pi Zero has the USB Vbus pins bridged to the 5v power rail, which
prevents the UDC from detecting bus disconnection. As a result, the display does
not change when the Pi is disconnected from the host, and refreshes twice when
reconnected. There is no workaround known so far.

Notes for Debian
****************

Tested on the unofficial (but excellent) `raspi Debian port`_ .

Sadly, the Debian kernel (as of this writing: 5.9-4) does not seem to support
DeviceTree overlays, so there is some extra work needed:

- fetch the kernel source for your current version (hint: apt-get source
  linux-image-...), possibly on another machine
- apply the following trivial patch to the DeviceTree compiler so it includes
  symbols in the generated binary:

  .. code:: diff

- build the correct DeviceTree binary file for your model (here, the zero-w).
  This can be done on another machine, hence the `ARCH` variable:

  .. code:: shell

    ARCH=arm make bcm2835-rpi-zero-w.dtb

- build the following overlay (using kernel-provided dtc command, you may also
  install it from the `device-tree-compiler` package)::

    // Enable spi0 interface (board pins 19, 21, 23, 24, 26)
    /dts-v1/;
    /plugin/;

    / {
    compatible = "brcm,bcm2835";
    };

    &gpio {
        alt0 {
            brcm,pins = <4 5>; // removed 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
        };
        spi0_cs_pins: spi0_cs_pins {
            brcm,function = <1>; // out
            brcm,pins = <7 8>;
        };
        spi0_pins: spi0_pins {
            brcm,function = <4>; // alt0
            brcm,pins = <9 10 11>;
        };
    };

    &spi {
        // CE0 is gpio 8, CE1 is gpio 7, both active low
        cs-gpios = <&gpio 8 0x01>, <&gpio 7 0x01>;
        status = "okay";
        pinctrl-0 = <&spi0_cs_pins &spi0_pins>;
        pinctrl-names = "default";
        #address-cells = <1>;
        #size-cells = <0>;
        spidev@0 {
            // "waveshare,epaper-display-v1": because that's what it really is.
            // "rohm,dh2228fv": this is a dirty hack, this value triggers spidev
            // to handle this device.
            compatible = "waveshare,epaper-display-v1", "rohm,dh2228fv";
            reg = <0>; // uses CS0
            #address-cells = <1>;
            #size-cells = <0>;
            spi-max-frequency = <4000000>; // 4MHz: tcycle >= 250ns
        };
    };

  .. code:: shell

    ${KERNEL_SOURCE}/scripts/dtc/dtc -I dts -O dtb -@ -o vanilla-enable-spi0.dtbo vanilla-enable-spi0.dts

- (optional) check that the overlay is consistent with kernel's dtb using
  fdtoverlay from the `device-tree-compiler` package:

  .. code:: shell

    fdtoverlay -i ${KERNEL_SOURCE}/arch/arm/boot/dts/bcm2835-rpi-zero-w.dtb -o /dev/null vanilla-enable-spi0.dtbo

  If this emits any error, then you pi may not boot with this overlay.

- install the with-symbols devicetree and the spi overlay (as root):

  .. code:: shell

    cp ${KERNEL_SOURCE}/arch/arm/boot/dts/bcm2835-rpi-zero-w.dtb /boot/firmware/bcm2835-rpi-zero-w_with-symbols.dtb
    mkdir -p /boot/firmware/overlays/
    cp vanilla-enable-spi0.dtbo /boot/firmware/overlays/

- tell the raspberry pi stage 2 bootloader about both files, by editing
  ``/boot/firmware/config.txt``::

    device_tree=bcm2835-rpi-zero-w_with-symbols.dtb
    dtoverlay=vanilla-enable-spi0.dtbo

For use as a module
+++++++++++++++++++

Without optional dependencies (to use as a python module in your own projects,
for example to assemble more complex gadgets).

.. code:: shell

  pip install smartcard-app-openpgp

Threat model
------------

In a nutshell:

- the system administrator of the device running this code is considered to be
  benevolent and competent
- the host accessing this device through the smartcard API (typically, via
  USB) is considered hostile
- the close-range physical world surrounding the device is considered to be
  under control of the device owner

In more details:

This code is intended to be used on general-purpose computing modules, unlike
traditional smartcard implementations. They cannot be assumed to have any
hardening against physical access to their persistent (or even volatile)
memory:

- it is trivially easy to pull the micro SD card from a Raspberry Pi Zero {,W}
- it is easy to solder wires on test-points between the CPU and the micros
  card on a Raspberry Pi Zero {,W} and capture traffic
- on an Intel Edison u-boot may be configured with DFU enabled, which, once
  triggered, allows convenient read access to the content of any partition
  it is configured to access
- electronic noise (including actual noise: coil whine) will leak information
  about what the CPU is doing
- they have communication channels dedicated smartcard hardware does not have:
  WiFi, Bluetooth, TTY on serial (possibly via USB), JTAG...

So if an attacker gets physical access to them, their secrets should be
considered fully compromised.

Further, some of these interfaces allow wide-range networking, which further
opens the device to remote attackers.

**The system configuration of the device on which this code runs is outside of
the area of responsibility of this project.**

Just like any general-purpose computer on which you would store PGP/GPG keys.

Origin story
------------

To do my daily job I rely on the same cryptographic operations as any other
sysadmin: ssh key-based authentication, mail signature and decryption. When
faced with the perspective of having to use a machine I do not trust enough
to give it access to the machines my ssh key has access to, nor to give it
access to the private key associated with my email address, I started looking
for alternatives.

So suddenly I needed another computer I trusted to hold those secrets, and go
through it from the machine I was told to use. Which is cumbersome, both in
volume (who wants to carry around two laptops ?) and in usage (one extra hop
for all accesses). All the while potentially leaking some credentials to the
untrusted machine (the credentials I need to present to the trusted machine to
get into my account and unlock my keys).

So I went looking for:

- A widely-compatible private key store protocol (so I do not have to start all
  over again the next time the policy changes).

  A smartcard and a smartcard reader seem a sensible choice: there are
  widespread standards describing their protocol and they have been around for
  long enough in professional settings to have reasonable level of support in
  a lot of operating systems.

- Is easy to carry around.

  In my view, this eliminates card readers with a built-in PIN pad, which means
  the PIN must be input through the keyboard of the untrusted computer, which
  leads me to the next point.

- Which would not rely on nearly-constant credentials, so I can keep the device
  plugged in for extended periods of time without having to worry about the
  untrusted machine using it behind my back.

  Smartcards rely on PINs, which, while they can be changed, I am sure nobody
  change after every single operation, much less from a trusted terminal. So
  once I have input my PIN on the untrusted computer, what's stopping it from
  reusing the PIN for further operations without my consent ?

  So I need some form of TOTP, but smartcards do not have an RTC (...that I
  know of), which means they are not aware of time, so they cannot internally
  produce something which can be both unpredictable to an attacker *and*
  predictable to a TOTP display where the user can tell what the current
  password is. But further than this: I would very much not rely on an RTC at
  all, so be resilient to NTP attacks.

  So I want a device which has a display capable of telling me what the PIN
  I need to use for the next operation is, and change this pin after every
  input. There exist high-end cards with build-in 7-segments displays, some
  even with a tactile pin pad, which leads to the next point.

- Which uses commonly-available hardware.

  I do not want to rely on a specific model, which may or may not remain
  available for the duration of my career.

  Instead, there are now commonly available USB-capable general-purpose
  computers for very affordable prices and with extension capabilities.
  And if a specific model is not available in a few years, then there should
  be another, thank to the maker communities relying on these devices
  (robotics, home automation, ...). I want to use these.

General-purpose devices come with a drawback, of course: they are not
physically hardened (see `Threat model`_). But so would my second laptop, so I
believe this is an improvement overall.

Final refinement: I want some resistance to casual misuse. With large-enough
displays, this is easy: instead of displaying a single random PIN, display an
array of random PINs, of which a single cell contains the correct PIN. The
larger the display and the smaller the font, the better the added security.
But as discussed above, the device should remain small, and this is only aimed
at a casual attacker: anyone motivated and competent enough will find other
ways to access the data.

Implementation principles
-------------------------

- how to manage memory: do not manage memory

  This module is implemented in pure python, to try to achieve a lower
  maintenance burden against buffer overflows that manual memory allocation
  languages are generally more prone to. It does interface (indirectly) with C
  code though, so there is a thin layer at which more care is required.

- how to implement good cryptography: do not implement cryptography

  This module does not implement cryptography itself. It uses the
  `pyca/cryptography`_ module for this, which itself typically relies on
  OpenSSL. Standing on the shoulders of these giants is mandatory.

  There are also places related to security but not related to cryptography
  which needs to be carefully implemented:

  - PIN checking. While this is ultra-low-level cryptography, manipulating PINs
    could leak timing information to the outside world, so it must be (and is)
    carefully done with time-constant functions.
  - random number generation (for GET_CHALLENGE method). The best source of
    system entropy must be used.
